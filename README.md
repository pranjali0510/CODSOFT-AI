# Projects-Artificial-Intelligence

This is a repository created to showcase the three projects that are created using Python.

CHATBOT WITH RULE-BASED RESPONSES                                 
•	This project is a Python-based chatbot named Alex, designed to engage in basic conversational interactions with users. Utilizing the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) for natural language processing tasks and regular expressions for pattern matching, Alex responds to user inputs with predefined responses. 
•	The chatbot starts by greeting the user and offers assistance, responding to queries about its capabilities and providing simple information. It handles various conversational intents such as greetings, inquiries about its name, and general assistance requests. 
•	The project showcases the integration of fundamental NLP techniques and demonstrates how a basic chatbot can be implemented in Python to facilitate interactive user experiences.

TIC-TAC-TOE AI		                                 	    	    	 
•	This project is a Python-based implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game with an AI opponent. Using the Pygame library for graphical interface, the game features a responsive grid layout where players can interact by clicking on squares to make their moves. 
•	The game supports two modes: player-versus-player (PvP) and player-versus-AI (Ai). In PvP mode, two human players take turns marking squares with crosses (X) and circles (O). In Ai mode, the player competes against an AI opponent programmed with varying levels of difficulty: random moves or a minimax algorithm for optimal play. 
•	The graphical interface updates dynamically to display the game state, including winning lines when a player achieves three marks in a row, column, or diagonal. Players can reset the game, change the game mode, or adjust the AI difficulty level using keyboard shortcuts. The project demonstrates basic game development concepts, AI decision-making algorithms, and interactive user interface design using Python and Pygame.

MOVIE RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM
• Developed a collaborative filtering-based movie recommendation system using cosine similarity and Python's pandas library.
• Constructed a user-item matrix from user ratings data, enabling efficient representation and analysis of user preferences for movies.
•Implemented functions to predict user ratings for unrated movies based on similar users' ratings and to recommend top movies to users, enhancing personalized movie suggestions.
